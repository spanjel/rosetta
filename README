The Two Implementations
- base: prison.v/prison
- optimized: prison_opt.v/prisoo

Proof of Equality: prisons_eq.v/prisons_eq

Proof Outline:
math.v: Prove that squares are the only ones with odd number of divisors
prison_opt_facts.v: prove that prisoo will only assign true at square indices
prison_flip_list.v/prisonl: collect the pass number in a list if a door state was flipped
prison_flip_list_facts.v/prisoneq: prove that the prison end state is equal to the evenness of of the list length
prisons_eq.v: prove that prison = prisoo, using the facts proved before

build: coq_makefile -o Makefile *.v && make
